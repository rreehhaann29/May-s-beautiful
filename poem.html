    <main><h2>Poem</h2><div class="content"><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
In a garden of roses who loves the thorns?
All want the petals, not one wishes to work the metal.
The gardens need a gardener.
Flowers wither and die
Who can bring them back to life?
All need a guide.
Some make their egos their God, and as autumn comes, they fall to their pride.
Some make their love their guide and when the love ends?
Then who will care through the cold winter night.
I've loved just one.
The one who can love me even before I was someone.
The one who will love me when I will be no one.
My love is for you,
I may not be the prettiest or the most fragrant flower.
Yet you tend to me like I'm the only flower meant to be.
I've seen you in all seasons.
You've never left me alone in the heavy rains or the snow filled storms
The blazing heat or the windy springs of love.
In all times I found your shade
For your lovers you've even turned the sun back for them to pray.
You have always been and will be.
For without you, I could not be.
