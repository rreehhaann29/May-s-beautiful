            <p>Happiest 'nineteen' to the most amazing, most beautiful, most charming , the prettiest, the cutestttt ,the most amazing girl that I have known since the last 3 yrs.</p>
            <p>Idk how to define these 3 yrs of being a part of your life but I'd definitely term myself as blessed and fortunate enough for it even if I make the smallest of the whole in ur life. From seeing you in person for 2 yrs consecutively to waiting for ur calls/texts every other day is nothing more but an existing proof of how etched you are into my life.</p>
            <p>I may be that boring person who doesn't speak much or has nothing much to tell u about his day but I can assure u of being the guy who'd try his heart out to speak things which would bring to u if not much then at least a smile or a moment of joy on the days where the weather hasn't been as pleasant as U thought it to be and ur day hasn't been better either.</p>
            <p>I may be that irritating or annoying guy u might wish not to talk to at times or whom u are done tolerating not once not twice not thrice but on several occasions but dear Pragati lemme tell u it's all a miniature form of love that I do express u this way though nothing intention to cause u any kind of trouble, it's all meant to be fun.</p>
            <p>Thank you for consistently taking care, intentionally or unintentionally, of this garden that's full of flowers that people may not have liked (and left it the way it was/is) or for the fact which U may haven't liked all these times but still hung on to be the difference, to be the one who has tried and waited patiently to see the changes...... You may have noticed or not noticed any changes yet but it's at work, the changes may be very slow or gradual but it'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be the garden that I dream of, I'll be the garden that you might've wanted me to be.</p>
            <p>Ohhh those calls with U lasting 1.5-2 hrs are some of the best hours of life cuz it's not just about my ears and heart being blessed with that voice but more of being lucky enough to hear you laugh, to feel your emotions whatever they may be, to be able to spend those 90-120 minutes just with you.</p>
            <p>Laapata Ladies and 'sajni' from it somehow are going to be special for me forrr longgg... 24th of May last year watching the movie till 12:30 am then discussing the movie and specially listening sajni on loop and the conversation till 4:30 in morning without getting bored for a second. Ahhh yet another instance of me failing to understand how U are able to keep me hooked to every convo I have with U. How do u do it? Why don't u seem uninteresting and how's it always? How are u so special? IDK... And idk if I'll ever be able to know and answer this to myself.</p>
            <p>Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou for letting me and allowing me to be part of your life, for being my SUKOON come what may, for every positive change you brought into me, for sharing nd letting me know about your day, for tolerating all the stupidity I do, for bearing with me, for being patient with me, for letting me be the reason you smiled or were happy anyday or at any moment. In case I have done any better/any good to you, I find myself lucky and fortunate enough to have done it, it's nothing more than a personal win for me.</p>
            <p>Loadssss of love, respect and bit of annoyance ur wayyyy</p>
            <p>Your very own <br>~ Acquaintance and Hybrid Pathan</p>
